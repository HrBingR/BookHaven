  - Added pyvips for rapid image conversion to webp, and image resize to h:300px, to improve performance when serving cover images.
  - Implemented redis caching for media endpoints, reducing the need for slower DB queries for cover image and ebook path retrieval, while maintaining DB fallback.
  - Fixed logic to actually disable OPDS when disabled in config, rather than simply not creating the required Redis instance.
  - Collapsed and streamlined redis DB config & properties to simplify usage.
