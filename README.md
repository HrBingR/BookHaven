## What the Application Does
BookHaven scans and manages your local library of EPUB ebooks, and allows you to read and download your ebooks on any of your devices, with a sleek, modern, and responsive interface.

Built using a modern tech stack, the frontend leverages React with the react-reader library to render and display EPUB files seamlessly in the browser, while the backend operates on Python Flask with Gunicorn as the web server. The application provides smooth animations, a clean UI, and robust performanceâ€”offering a great reading experience for all users.

## Features
- **Fast and Lightweight**
  Built with React and Flask, the app provides excellent performance and a responsive, smooth experience on any device.
- **Read eBooks in the Browser**
  Users can access and read their EPUB-formatted eBooks directly without any additional software.
- **Download eBooks**
  Easily download a copy of any eBook in the collection to your device.
- **Non-Destructive Metadata Editing**
  Changes to eBook metadata (e.g., title, author, series) are stored in the database, leaving the original EPUB files untouched.
- **Automatic or Manual Library Scanning**
  Once deployed the app will periodically, on a configurable interval, scan your library for any changes, while also allowing for manual library scans.
- **Home Page with Alphabetical Sorting**
  Books are sorted first alphabetically by their author and then by series, offering a clean and intuitive browsing experience.
- **Powerful Search**
  The search feature on the home page allows users to filter their library by author, book title, or series, helping locate specific content quickly.
- **Filters**
  Basic filters are made available to allow filtering for books marked as favorite, as finished, or books that haven't been marked as finished.
- **Author Page with Intuitive Navigation**
  A dedicated author page organizes authors into a clickable alphabetical grid. Users can click on a letter to expand its list of authors, navigate to an author's page, and view their books sorted alphabetically by series and standalone titles.
- **Responsive Design**
  Fully optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience across screen sizes.
- **Fluid Animations**
  Smooth and visually pleasing animations enhance navigation and interaction with the application.
- **React Reader Integration**
  Uses the react-reader library to render EPUB files in the browser, supporting adjustable font sizes and progress saving.
- **Modern Backend**
  Python Flask is used as the backend framework, coupled with Gunicorn as the lightweight web server for efficient request handling, and Celery to perform asynchronous tasks.
- **Supports Multiple Databases**
  Compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite for storing metadata.
- **Supports CloudFlare Access**
  Has a flag to bypass the login screen when making use of CloudFlare Access. See `.env.example` for details.
- **OIDC Support**
  Allows for the configuration of OIDC for new user registration, and for existing users.

## Deployment
### Docker
Follow these steps to deploy the application with Docker Compose:
1. **Download Configuration Files**
Download or clone the repository to get `compose.yml.example` and `.env.example`.

2. **Rename the Example Files**
``` bash
   mv compose.yml.example compose.yml
   mv .env.example .env
```
3. **Customize the `.env` File**

Edit `.env` to configure essential settings:

    - **BASE_DIRECTORY**: Path to your eBooks directory.
    - **BASE_URL**: URL where your app will be accessible.
    - **DB_TYPE**: Database engine (e.g., mysql, sqlite, postgres).
    - _Other DB_ settings_* for your database configuration.

4. **Start the Application**

Run the following command:
``` bash
   docker compose up -d
```
This starts the `BookHaven`, Redis, and MySQL containers.
5. **Access the Application**

Open your browser and navigate to the `BASE_URL`:`APP_PORT` you configured (default is `http://localhost:5000`).

6. **Stopping the Application**

``` bash
   docker compose down
```

### Development
Follow these steps to deploy for development:
1. **Clone the repository**:
``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/HrBingR/BookHaven.git
   cd BookHaven
```

2. **Rename the example files**:
```bash
   mv compose.exmaple.yml compose.yml
   mv .env.example .env
```

3. **Customize the `.env` file**:

Edit `.env` to configure essential settings.

4. **Modify the `compose.yml` file**:

Change:

```yaml
    epub-reader:
       image: hrbingr/bookhaven:latest
```

To:

```yaml
  epub-reader:
     build:
        context: .
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
```

5. **Build the container**:
```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
```

6. **Access the app**:

Access the app on the `BASE_URL` and `APP_PORT` defined in the `.env` file.

## Building the Application
To build the application for production:
1. **Build the Frontend**:
``` bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build:dev
```
2. **Build the Docker Image**:

In the root project directory (BookHaven), run:
``` bash
   docker build -t tag:version .
```
Replace `tag:version` with your preferred image name and version (e.g., `bookhaven:1.0.0`).

## Change log:

- v1.0.x - Initial Release
- v1.1.0 - Added OIDC support
- v1.1.1 - Fixed a bug where OIDC front-end components would still render with OIDC disabled.
